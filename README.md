        Like TCP/IP in the 1970s and 1980s, blockchain is a new,
        intriguing but grossly misunderstood technology that is still
        in its infancy. It is commonly misunderstood as just a
        technology for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However,
        blockchain's use cases extend beyond just financial
        transactions and cryptocurrencies, and have the potential to
        transform nearly every industry including healthcare and
        supply chain. As the technology matures, additional
        transformative use cases could expand into drug distribution
        and specifically to opioid supply chains. Despite this
        potential, a publicly-available blockchain specifically for
        opioid supply chains was not found. Therefore, to demonstrate
        how a blockchain would function on a simplified opioid supply
        chain, a blockchain, using Python code, was developed as a
        proof of concept. This source code is publicly available to
        allow others to further develop the blockchain model for more
        complex and real-world opioid supply chains. The collective
        review and analysis of blockchain, pharmaceutical supply
        chains, the opioid crisis, and the demonstrated blockchain
        model suggest that the adoption of blockchain systems for
        prescription opioid supply chains would enable numerous
        capabilities that could mitigate certain aspects of the opioid
        crisis.
